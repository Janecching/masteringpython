# REMEMBER
    # DRAW IT OUT!!

# TECHNIQUES
    # Multiple passes (find len, save info about content)
    # Slow and fast pointers
    # Dummy node (for returning head for merging, deleting)

# EDGE CASES
    # head is null, single node, two nodes, have cycles

# COMMON OPERATIONS
    # merging 2 linked list: similar to merge sort, copy non empty
    # reverse linked list: use prev, curr, next
    # find middle node: while fast and fast.next
    # counting num of nodes
    # truncate list: set next ot null
    # swap values of nodes: just like array, no need to change next ptrs
    # combine lists: attach head to tail

# COMPLEXITY
    # Insert	O(1)	Assumes you have traversed to the insertion position
    # Remove	O(1)	Assumes you have traversed to the node to be removed
    # Access	O(n)	
    # Search	O(n)
